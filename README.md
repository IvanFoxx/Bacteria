# Bacteria

The Bacteria Simulation Project is a C++ program that utilizes genetic algorithms to simulate the behavior and evolution of bacteria. This project is built from scratch and aims to study the interactions and behaviors of simulated bacteria populations through the implementation of genetic algorithms.

## Installation
To install the Bacteria Simulation Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ivanko09/Bacteria.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Bacteria`
3. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
4. Install dependencies using Conan: `conan install ..`
5. Generate build files using CMake: `cmake ..`
6. Build the project: `cmake --build .`

## Usage
After building the project, you can run the bacteria simulation from the command line:

```bash
./Bacteria
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation. Observe the behavior of the simulated bacteria populations as they evolve over time using genetic algorithms.

## Features
- Simulates the behavior and evolution of bacteria using genetic algorithms.
- Written from scratch in C++.
- Provides insights into how genetic algorithms can influence and model complex behaviors.
